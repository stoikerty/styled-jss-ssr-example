# styled-jss SSR Example

Example of using [styled-jss](https://github.com/cssinjs/styled-jss) in a server-rendered scenario.

```bash
# Install Dependencies
npm i

# Run in development (with server-side hot-reload of client code)
npm run dev

# Generate a pre-rendered build
npm run build
```

This example uses [dev-toolkit](https://github.com/stoikerty/dev-toolkit), an easy and quick way to get started with a pre-rendered & server-rendered app.
